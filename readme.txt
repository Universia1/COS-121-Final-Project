This is a basic text-based adventure game that takes place in the fantasy world, Celestia. The player can travel between multiple areas: a cave where they will encounter enemies that drop gold (G) when slain and become more powerful after the player has obtained the Blade of Cinders, a shop where the player can purchase and sell items, a tavern where the player pays G to rest and heal their HP back to full, and a dungeon that contains the final boss. All zones are accessed from the central hub, the town square. The final dungeon can be traveled to, but is locked off to the player until they have killed 100 enemies in the cave. The player wins the game by defeating the final boss in the dungeon.
