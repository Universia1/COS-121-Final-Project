I initially began this final project thinking it was going to be relatively simple and straightforward, but I was quite mistaken. In the beginning, it was pretty easy and I thought it wouldn't take too long to finish the project. As I kept adding functions, things began getting more and more complicated and all sorts of crashes and unwanted events/logic errors kept popping up along the way. It is definitely not out of the realm of possibility that some input from the player might cause a crash, but as far as I am aware, the game is fully functioning and does not crash when playtesting.

During the last 6 days, I was unable to do much, if any work on other class' projects/studying because I was constantly trying to fix my code for this project so that the game would run as smoothly as I could get it. I stayed up until past 3am working on debugging the code and sacrificing a lot of sleep in order to finish this project before the deadline.

I did enjoy working on this project and it was really cool being able to make a game like this on my own, but unfortunately because of the added stress of needing to meet the deadlines of projects/papers and studying for other exams, the last week of working on this project was incredibly stressful. I probably would not have been able to complete this project on time if not for Mr. Schotter's help over the course of this project when I was stuck and really needed it. To Mr. Schotter: thank you so much for being there to explain the issues I was trying to solve in an easy to understand way and being there to help when I was at my most stressed points during the last few days of working on this project.
